Simple (Stupidly Implemented Mathematical Platform - Light Edition)
===================================================================

This is version 1.0 of the C++ library Simple.

So far it contains a "littlenum" library, for multiplication of bignums which
are not too big (due to performance issues).

The modules it contains are:

* dlimb.h : some macros for double limb arithmetic

* twos.c/h : functions for doing arithmetic with numbers in twos complement format

* nat.c/h : a class for doing arithmetic with unsigned bignums, with automatic memory management

* znat.c/h : a class for doing arithmetic with signed bignums, with automatic memory management

WARNING: Simple contains bugs. In fact, there is very little test code. It is also slow for integers of more than about 30 limbs. And it only works on x86/x86_64 due to the definition of count_leading_zeros in simple.h.

Performance Comparison:
-----------------------

The following pseudocode was implemented in MPIR-2.6.0 and Simple:

a = 1234567890123456789

b = 1234567890123456789

for (i = 0; i < 100000000; i++)
   a += b

The timings are as follows:

Simple : 1.8s

MPIR : 1.8s

A generic C version of MPIR is slower.
